Falconce is a crypto prices web app where you can check the last-minute prices of cryptocurrencies or you can search for any active coin in the market. 

I built this app with two APIs from the top crypto data providers CoinMarketCap & CoinGecko. I had to use both of them to get around the problem of the limitation of data of free tiers. 

The site is live, the frontend is hosted on Netlify and the backend is on render. You can visit it here: https://falconce.netlify.app

My goal in building this was to simulate a professional work environment:

- This application is somewhat similar to a lot of Crypto prices tracking apps.
- I used git branches, pushes, and pull requests to practice it.
- I used Redux to fetch data and manage them.
- I used Node Js for the backend as I plan to become a full-stack dev, but I'm focused on the front end now.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
